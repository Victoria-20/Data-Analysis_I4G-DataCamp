### A Network Analysis of Game of Thrones

If you haven't heard of Game of Thrones, then you must be really good at hiding. 
Game of Thrones is the hugely popular television series by HBO based on the (also) 
hugely popular book series A Song of Ice and Fire by George R.R. Martin. 
In this notebook, we will analyze the **co-occurrence network** of the characters in the Game of Thrones books. 
Here, two characters are considered to co-occur if their names appear in the vicinity of 15 words from one another in the books.

#### Modules used in this analysis include:
**1. NetworkX**
NetworkX is a Python package for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks.
