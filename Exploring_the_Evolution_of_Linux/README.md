## Exploring the Evolution of Linux

Version control repositories like CVS, Subversion or Git can be a real gold mine for software developers. They contain every change to the source code including the date (the "when"), the responsible developer (the "who"), as well as a little message that describes the intention (the "what") of a change.

In this notebook, we will analyze the evolution of a very famous open-source project â€“ the Linux kernel. The Linux kernel is the heart of some Linux distributions like Debian, Ubuntu or CentOS. Our dataset at hand contains the history of kernel development of almost 13 years (early 2005 - late 2017). We get some insights into the work of the development efforts by

- identifying the TOP 10 contributors and
- visualizing the commits over the years.
